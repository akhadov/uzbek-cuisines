### Setup

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. Clone the repository
2. At the root directory, restore required packages by running:

```bash
 dotnet restore
```

3. Next, build the solution by running:

```bash
dotnet build
```

### Running the Solution

1. Start dockerized PostgreSQL Server

```bash
docker compose up
```

2. Run the solution

```bash
dotnet run
```

> **NOTE:** The first time you run the solution, it may take a while to download the docker images, create the DB, and seed the data.

   
You should be able to make requests to localhost:5001 for the Public API project once these commands complete. If you have any problems, especially with login, try from a new guest or incognito browser instance.

You can also run the applications by using the instructions located in their `Dockerfile` file in the root of each project. Again, run these commands from the root of the solution (where the .sln file is located).
